# Football Stadium Rental Application

## Introduction

The Football Stadium Rental Application is designed to meet the needs of football enthusiasts who want to experience playing on a real stadium. The core idea is to create a platform where users can create an account and ultimately rent a football stadium, eliminating the need to watch the game from a small TV screen or from the stands of their favorite team. The application also serves as a tool for administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user, stadium, and equipment data.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Python**: The backend is built using Python due to its simplicity, readability, and efficient development capabilities. Python is well-known for its large community and rich set of libraries, making it ideal for web application development.
- **Django**: Django is a high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is used for:
  - **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Django’s ORM allows easy interaction with the database using Python objects, eliminating the need for writing raw SQL.
  - **Model-View-Template Architecture**: Django’s separation of concerns makes it easy to organize the project into models (data structure), views (business logic), and templates (presentation layer).
  - **Authentication System**: Django includes an authentication system for managing users, permissions, and sessions, which is crucial for this project.
  - **Admin Panel**: Django provides a pre-built admin interface that allows administrators to perform CRUD operations on stadiums, equipment, and users.
  - **Security**: Django is designed with security in mind, protecting against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and more.

### Frontend

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: HTML forms the structure of the application, including the layout for stadium listings, user forms, and rental sections.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: CSS is used for styling the HTML elements, giving the application a pleasant and intuitive visual design.
- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is a responsive frontend framework used to make the application mobile-first and ensure a responsive design that works across different screen sizes and devices.
- **jQuery**: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document manipulation, event handling, animations, and AJAX requests, providing an interactive user experience.

### Database

- **Database Models**: The database consists of tables for users, stadiums, reservations, equipment, and orders. Relationships between these tables (e.g., users to reservations, stadiums to reservations) are maintained to reflect how entities interact.
- **Normalization**: The database is normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Transactions**: Transactions are crucial for ensuring the integrity and consistency of financial transactions, such as virtual wallet loading or payment for stadium rental.
- **Optimized Queries**: Database queries are optimized using indexes and proper query design to ensure a fast user experience.

### Design Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern**: The Singleton pattern is used to manage database connections. This ensures that only one instance of the database connection is created, preventing the creation of multiple unnecessary or costly connections.

  Example:
  ```python
  class DatabaseConnection:
      instance = None

      @classmethod
      def new(cls):
          if cls.instance is None:
              cls.instance = super(DatabaseConnection, cls).new()
              # Initialize the database connection here
          return cls.instance
